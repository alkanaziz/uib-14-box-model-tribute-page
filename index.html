        <blockquote>
          <p>
            "Christopher Nolan doesn't make sense. And that is exactly how he
            likes it. In twenty-three years and through twelve films, he has
            defied the laws of Hollywood by creating startling, original genre
            pieces that have revelled in their own complexity, confounding every
            maxim by which the studios hope to appeal to the widest audience.
            And yet he does that too. Cinemas fill on the possibility of the
            next Nolan film. Whatever form it might take."
